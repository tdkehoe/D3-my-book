_Interactive Date Visualization for the Web_, by Scott Murray

This is the best beginner book. Murray assumes you know nothing. The book is a tutorial that walks you step by step through making bar charts, scatter charts, etc. I'm taking off a star because it should have exercises to challenge you to think, because some necessary topics are glossed over, and other unnecessary topics are included.


_Data Visualization with D3.js Cookbook_, by Nick Qi Zhu, pages 23-38.

This is a good advanced book.


_D3.js in Action_, by Elijah
This book throws advanced topics at the reader in chapter 1. The "hello world" first D3 app, 40 pages into the book (!), is complex, with many methods, including animations.
It uses analogies to explain concepts that could be demonstrated without analogies.
