_Interactive Date Visualization for the Web_, by Scott Murray

This is the best beginner book. Murray assumes you know nothing. The book is a tutorial that walks you step by step through making bar charts, scatter charts, etc. I'm taking off a star because it should have exercises to challenge you to think, because some necessary topics are glossed over, and other unnecessary topics are included.


_Data Visualization with D3.js Cookbook_, by Nick Qi Zhu, pages 23-38.

This is a good advanced book.
